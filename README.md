## ❓ FAQ

### Is luna executor safe to use?
Luna executor itself is safe when downloaded from official sources. However, all script executors carry inherent risks within Roblox's Terms of Service. We implement anti-detection features, but no executor can guarantee complete safety from account actions.

### Do I need to pay for luna executor?
No! Luna executor is completely free. We believe in providing accessible tools for the Roblox community. Beware of websites claiming to sell "premium" versions—these are scams.

### Why does my antivirus flag luna executor?
Script executors modify game memory, which antivirus software often identifies as suspicious behavior. This is a false positive. Add luna executor to your antivirus exclusions, but only download from official sources.

### Can I use luna executor on multiple devices?
Yes! Luna executor supports installation on multiple devices. Simply download the appropriate version for each platform (Windows, Android, etc.) and follow the installation instructions.

### What should I do if injection fails?
Try these solutions: restart Roblox, run luna executor as Administrator, temporarily disable antivirus, ensure you're using the latest version, or check our Discord server for real-time troubleshooting assistance.

### Will using luna executor get me banned?
While we implement advanced anti-detection systems, using any script executor violates Roblox's Terms of Service. There's always a risk of account penalties. We strongly recommend using alt accounts to protect your main profile.

### How often is luna executor updated?
We release updates weekly to address Roblox patches, add new features, and improve stability. The built-in auto-updater ensures you're always running the most current version.
